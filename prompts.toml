The majority of the time, the type will be noted in the log message, if it is not, and the type of event is not easily determined, mark it as a 'Patrol'. Once you have determined the event type, scan the log for users marked as 'Attendees', 'Host' and 'Co host'. If any field are missing, such as there being no Co host, ignore the Co host line. If the event says 'practice', for example 'practice raid', the event is to be marked as a training."
